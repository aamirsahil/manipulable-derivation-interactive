# Enacting-Oscillation
This project is aimed at augmenting the teaching and learning of derivations in physics. Interactivity and a model-based-reasoning meta-language are two key design components of this learning intervention. The system can currently be experienced on Google Chrome on a Laptop/PC using this link: https://ambargithub.github.io/manipulable-derivation-interactive/0.0_Outline.html
